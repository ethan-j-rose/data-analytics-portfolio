# Ethan Rose's Data Analytics Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my data analytics portfolio. I have created this to showcase my skills and experience in data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Projects

### 1. Crop Analysis with Tableau

**Summary**: This project analyzes global production data for various crops in 2022. The primary objective is to identify the top producing countries for different crops and understand the factors influencing their production. The analysis provides insights into agricultural productivity, trends, and patterns across different countries and crops.
- **Questions**:
  1. Which countries are the top producers for each crop in 2022?
  2. How does crop production compare across different regions and continents?
  3. Which countries have the highest yield efficiency for each crop in 2022?
  4. What are the most commonly produced crops in different regions?
- **Answers**:
  1. **Top Producers**: Different countries lead in the production of various crops. For example, the top producers of wheat include China, India, and Russia.
  2. **Regional Comparison**: Crop production varies significantly across regions, with Asia leading in rice production, while the Americas dominate soybean production.
  3. **Yield Efficiency**: Countries like the Netherlands and the United States have high yield efficiencies for certain crops due to advanced agricultural practices.
  4. **Crop Variety**: In Asia, rice and wheat are the most commonly produced crops, while in the Americas, maize and soybeans are prevalent.

#### Detailed Project Documentation

##### Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Collected data from FAOSTAT on global crop production.
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Analysis**: Used Tableau to visualize the data and identify key trends and insights.
- **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards to allow users to explore the data.

##### Challenges
- **Data Quality**: Addressed issues with missing and inconsistent data through data cleaning techniques.
- **Visualization**: Ensured that the visualizations were clear and informative by choosing appropriate chart types and color schemes.
